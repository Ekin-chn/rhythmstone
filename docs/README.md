# Rhythm Stone Docs

This folder collects product-facing documents for the Rhythm Stone system:

- Interaction flow diagrams and UI mockups for the web controller.
- Hardware wiring and pinout references for the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3 build.
- Prompt design notes and API schemas for the recommendation engine.
- Deployment runbooks for demos with or without hardware attached.

Add diagrams (e.g., from Figma/Excalidraw) and wiring pictures here to keep the hardware and web teams aligned.
